## Extension: Rewrap

The Rewrap extension allows inserting hard wraps into your paragraphs at
the configured text wrap setting. Use `ALT+Q` to hard-wrap a paragraph.

Using hard wraps helps during side-by-side review of changes. Sometimes
the word wrapping causes a small change to modify the entire paragraph,
but very long lines are generally harder to review.
